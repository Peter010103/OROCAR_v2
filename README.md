# OROCAR_v2
A low-cost learning platform for SLAM, Autonomous Driving, and Indoor Racing

## Hardware
The base frame is from the Waveshare Jetracer AI Kit [(link)](https://www.waveshare.com/jetracer-ai-kit.htm). You can 3d print the frame and the alternative camera mounting solution found in the assets folder. The .stp and the original .f3z file is also in this folder should you wish to modify the designs. The frame is suitable for the Raspberry Pi, but I haven't tested it with the Jetson Nano. Check the design files for sizing.
